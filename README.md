<p align="center">A progressive lego like <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Golang</a> framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications or microservices.</p>

## Description
It uses <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us">lego</a> like blocks approach so everything is distributed as plugins whatever you need to use just add the plugin which makes it the most flexible framework for building the applications or microservices.

## Why another framework when there are already many?
`FYI - It's not a framework just a boilerprate can be customized fully based on your needs`

There are lots of framework available out there but when your codebase becomes bigger it becomes hard to keep the everything update and maintainable with those 3rd party frameworks and to me personally 3rd part tools seems like blackbox. Offcourse i used 3rd party some modules to built this boilerplate but i tried to keep them as minimal as possible and also i made i like so you can customize almost every single code so you do not have to be dependent on 3rd party fraemworks.
